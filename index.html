        <p class> Currently an undergraduate Computer Science student in Purdue. My main interests lie in Machine Learning and Data Analysis but am always open to explore new areas!
            Outside of school I like to play basketball and am currently the two-time defending champion of my Fantasy Basketball League which I am conveniently also the commissioner of (nothing suspicious here please ignore). </p>
